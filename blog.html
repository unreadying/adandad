	<h2>day 15 : nothing to report </h2>
	<p>
	15 days have passed since i started this blog . i've already run out of things to say , and nothing new has happened . i guess i'll run you through my daily routine for job searching so you can know what not to do . <br><br>
	i use a program i made called <a href='https://xerelia.ca/punk'>punk records</a> as a central base for online operations . in punk records i have a bookmark group filled with job boards where i might find some work . i basically just check those everyday
	apply for any new ones and then usually try and reach out to some people . so far this has lead to no interviews .

	<h2>day 10 : cocooning</h2>
	<p>as society has been moving towards the dreaded digital world , humans seem to be changing their behavior . now , i was born this century so i won't claim to be an expert on the change of society , but this is my blog so i will speak my mind god damn it .
	I THINK : humans have historically been very reliant on each other , but in the 21st century , our reliance on humans is gradually being replaced with reliance on 
	computers . gasp . 
	<br><br>
	ancient rome
	<br><br>
	the ancient romans seem to have had a fear of isolation , well from what i understand they weren't scared of being alone so much as they were weirded out by it . think about this , romans bathed together in communal baths . 
	i am willing to bet most modern young people find the idea of public pools weird . let alone public baths .

	<br><br>
	but now being alone is romantisized . it is seen as stoic and desireable . partying is increasingly frowned upon , and working from home is coveted . i want to work in an office , and i want to go party . but i'm still applying
	to jobs using this glowing box in my room .
	<br><br>
	yeah i'm just venting lol .

	<h2>day 9 : hiccups</h2>
	<p>well i just missed about 7 days of job searching ... i guess i am a lazy bastard ... and i barely looked today . sometimes i wish i moved somewhere further , hard to say if that would be better or worse .
	i love my family and my friends , but ' looking for work ' is not ' working ' . well i'm sure they would understand .
	<br><br>
	do you need confidence to work in advertising ? what is confidence ? i think thats a topic for another day .

	<h2>day 3 : believe</h2>
	<p>is belief the opposite of trying ? last week the canucks scored 3 points in the last minute , tying the game ; trailing by 3 with a minute left must feel hopeless  , i mean , no nhl team had ever won in that situation . honestly it would be insane to truly
	believe you could win at that point , i doubt any of the players predicted the outcome of that game . they were definitely giving it their all in the last minute , but did they really believe that they would win ? 
<br><br>
	all i know is that when your back is against the wall , belief only goes so far . what matters is that you do everything in your power to win . whether or not the canucks believed , they pushed as hard as possible . it seems that belief is not all it takes to win ,
	but if you give up , then you might stop trying . trying is all it takes to win .

	<h2>day 1 : why ?</h2>
	<p>hello . my name is evan stover . first things first : 
	<br><br>
	<b>why i don't capitalize my letters</b><br>
	because capital letters are the most pointless thing in the english language . please , please let me know if you ever find my writing style inhibits you from understanding my writing . obviously i wouldn't write like this for a client ( unless they asked me to ) .
	but seriously , i'm just trying to make english a more functional and beautiful language . yes i've been told it looks unprofessional , but why ? clearly i have a comprehensive understanding of the english language , clearly i know how im <i>supposed</i> to write ,
	so stop giving me a hard time for having fun with my personal writing style .
	<br><br>
	okay that probably isn't the first thing i need to expain , but i doubt anyone will ever read this anyways so whatever . i graduated with an advertising degree about 8 months ago from an art school in toronto called <a href='https://ocadu.ca'>ocadu</a> i have an advertising degree now , so i figure i may aswell make a go of it and try to make
	some ads . last month i moved to vancouver without a job , my friend was looking for a roommate , and i thought it would be easier to get a job in vancouver if i lived here .
	<br><br>
	ive spent the past month applying and emailing agencies and ad people
	with barely any response . so far i've met with <a href='https://brandsinvestorslove.com/'>Marc Stoiber</a> and <a href='https://www.weareskeletoncrew.ca/'>James Hearn</a> , both very kind and experienced advertisers , but neither had a job for me . so now im left to fend for myself in this new city with basically zero connections . 'whatever , i don't mind the challenge' .
	<br><br>
	i also want to shout out a little blog called <a href='https://mikecatherall.blogspot.com/'>freelance english copywriter in hong kong</a> by Mike Catherall , it was his blog that gave me the idea for this one ; although i'm not nearly as cool or passionate as he was . 
	i feel that a lot has changed since Mike went on his adventure to hong kong , so i'm not really sure how to handle this , but i guess i'll try and figure it out . 
	<br><br>
	well that pretty much sums up why i'm starting this blog and what its about . i'll try and update it with my stuggles and successes as they come , and maybe this will help you in some way. peace .
