            <b>sustainable advertising</b><br><br>
            mountain sky is a toronto based soap brand that is fully commited to sustainability ,
            selling river friendly soaps in biodegradable packaging .
            they approached us asking for one thing : sustainable advertising . the rest was up to us . 
        </p>
           
            <p class = "bodytext">
                <b>our solution</b><br><br>
                the key to our solution was derived from mountain sky's approach . 
                the fact that their soaps are "river friendly" holds a valuable insight : that most soaps are not . 
                we began to think about other objects that could be sustainabile but generally are not . that is how we came on this idea :
                sustainable advertising advertising sustainability . 
                <br>  
                
            </p>

        <p class="bodytext">the few ads we rolled out each shared the same goal : 
            to make people think about how few products are good for the environment . 
            hopefuly it would make people reconsider their habits ( and maybe even buy mountain sky soap ) .
            it also brings to light how commited mountain sky is to the environment .
