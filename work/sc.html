our first client and long term partner , <a target='_blank' id='sclink' href='https://sashascars.ca'>Sasha's Cars</a> has been renting classic picture cars to the GTA since 2019 . <br><br>
in early 2024 , we approached Sasha Fatsevych of Sasha's Cars . we had heard he wanted help growing his brand , so we prepared a pitch deck with some ideas and gave him a call .
being focused on renting cars and growing his collection since the start , Sasha's internet presence was very minimal when we first started working with him ; wanting to give his brand a greater sense of legitimacy ,
we got to work on a website right away
<a id='sclink2' href='https://sashascars.ca' target='_blank'>( <u>which you can check out here</u> )</a> in addition to making regular posts on his instagram <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' id='sciglink'href='https://www.instagram.com/sashas.cars/'>( <u>linked here</u> )</a>
featuring clients that had rented Sasha's Cars .<br><br>
we know that Sasha's website and instagram are likely to be a clients first interaction with his brand , so we have been working to keep them informative and engaging . now that Sasha's Cars has an accessible first touch point for future clients ,
we are continuing our work for Sasha by creating advertisements . at the moment we are working on short form videos for his social media pages .
