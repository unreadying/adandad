            <b>resurrection</b><br><br>
            wilkins coffee decided it was time to re emerge into the world . that why they asked us to revive their classic "wilkins wontkins"
            campaign . watch the original campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVewx3-9x24">here</a> .
            jim henson is credited with creating the commercials , which utilize his iconic puppets .
        </p>
           
            <p class = "bodytext">
                <b>our approach</b><br><br>
                we wanted our campaign to follow the original closely , without being the exact same . 
                to this end we decided to utilise our in house animator who was able to bring hensons characters
                to life in a brand new medium . 
                <br>  
                
            </p>

        <p class="bodytext">
            thanks to the fast paced short form style of the originals, we felt the classic formula would transfer
            well to digital avenues . with this in mind we began to ideate dozens of plots , before ultimately deciding
            to choose one and animate it . check that out below .
