            <b>encouraging discourse</b><br><br>
            as humans began to exit their isolation during the aftermath of the covid-19 lockdown era , we were approached by an intriguing private client . 
            the client (who would prefer to stay anonymous) came to us with a simple problem : people had forgotten how to socialize. it was thus our task to guide people
            into a more social future , accelerating the return to normalcy that would surely follow.

                <b>our solution</b><br><br>
                our first breakthrough came about when we realized this : humans are connected by common interests . this insight led to many possible
                solutions , each focusing on using common interests to connect people . 
                 after much iteration , we settled on creating a series of installations designed to provoke conversation
                <br>  
                
            </p>

        <p class="bodytext">the idea is quite simple , each installation has a different "niche" interest written on it , alongside a marked area . 
            if someone chooses to place themselves there , they are telling people something about themselves ;
            then if a passerby is also interested in said "niche" , they may just be tempted to start a conversation .
